abstract: This study examines how varieties of post-coup government stability shape the dynamics of civil wars. Post-coup trajectories of government vary widely, and these differences are especially consequential in countries already experiencing civil conflict. In such contexts, coup attempts can either exacerbate violence or open opportunities for peace. Nevertheless, existing studies on political stability often focus on single observable outcomes—such as regime change, leader survival, or violence—without accounting for the latent dynamics that produce them. Drawing on original measures of post-coup government stability, derived from a broad set of political, economic, and conflict indicators, the analysis distinguishes among stability achieved through legitimacy-building, stability enforced through repression, and continued instability. Using cross-national monthly data on coup-affected countries engaged in civil war, the study evaluates the effects of these trajectories of government stability on conflict severity, conflict management, and resolution outcomes. The findings show that legitimacy-building after coups significantly increases the likelihood of peace agreements and reduces conflict severity by mitigating various components of commitment problems, whereas other trajectories have little effect or may even worsen conflict dynamics. This study underscores the importance of not only \textit{whether} stability is restored after coups, but also \textit{how} it is restored: for long-term peace, peacebuilding efforts should prioritize rebuilding government stability through legitimacy-building. The findings also advance our understanding of commitment problems by revealing their varied intensities across different political contexts and by identifying specific mechanisms through which they can be resolved.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Different trajectories of post-coup government stability—legitimacy-building, repression, or continued instability—shape civil war dynamics, with legitimacy-building reducing conflict severity and fostering peace while other trajectories have little or adverse effects.
